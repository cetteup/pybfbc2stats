### Pattern

| Attribute           | Measuring (as per game files)   | Description (from game files) |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `c_{weapon}__dwa_g` | `StatEvent_DeathWith_X_As_Y`    | Deaths with ยน                 |
| `c_{weapon}__kw_g`  | `StatEvent_KillWith_X_As_Y`     | Kills with                    |
| `c_{weapon}__sfw_g` | `StatEvent_ShotsFired_With_X`   | Shots fired with              |
| `c_{weapon}__shw_g` | `StatEvent_ShotsHit_With_X`     | Shots hit with                |
| `c_{weapon}__sw_g`  | `StatEvent_SecondsWith_X`       | Seconds with                  |
| `c__{weapon}_hsa_g` | `StatEvent_HeadshotAs_X_With_Y` | Headshots received from       |
| `c__{weapon}_hsh_g` | `StatEvent_Headshot_X_With_Y`   | Headshots taken with          |

ยน it may seem like this is intended to reflect "deaths while weapon was equipped", but it is in fact "deaths from weapon"/"deaths to enemies using weapon"

## Awards

### Pattern

There are at least two keys per awards, always following the same pattern.

| Attribute       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{award}_00`    | Number of times awarded                                                     |
| `{award}_01`    | Timestamp when (last) awarded                                               |
| `c_{award}_...` | Key indicating progress towards award (optional, award may have multiple) ยน |

ยน stop counting once the award was obtained (e.g. c_ac11___ccp_g stops at 5, c_ac12___ccp_g at 25 control points captured)

### Achievements

Achievements can only be awarded once, so the `{award}_00` values (number of times awarded) will all be `0.0` or `1.0`.

### Stamps

Stamps can be awarded any number of times, so the `{award}_00` values (number of times awarded) can be `0.0` or any positive number. Requirements must be fulfilled within a single round, which why stamps do not have keys indicating progress.
